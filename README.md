# Arcade Game
A class project in a team of four that was programmed to build an arcade game. The user is placed in a map with hidden monsters and health potions to get through the game, and levels up as they go to different maps. The user has different ways to attack his or her enemy (attack damage or magic damage) but the amount of damage dealt to the enemy is random. The user also has an option to run away from the enemy which causes him or her to be taken to a random area in the map to continue the game. 

# Music Box 
This program uses a MIDI synthesizer to play notes and scales based on the user's input. When the user enters their desired note, the program converts their input into its MIDI value and plays that value on a certain frequency. For example, if the user enters "C", then the program will convert that input into the number 65 and uses the MIDI synthesier to play that note through the speaker. 

If you want to check to see if flats, sharps, or octaves work, type in "b", "#", or "^". "b" and "#" must be typed after the note and "^" must be placed before the note. 
Ex: Ab, C#, ^^C, ^G#
